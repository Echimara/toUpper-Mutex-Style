## toUpper: Mutex Style

Displays the power of mutex locks—programming tools that allow only one thread to access a shared resource at a time, preventing conflicts—by converting characters in a user-inputted sentence to uppercase via multi-threading.  

## Logistics:
* This C program showcases mutex lock behavior by converting characters in a user-input sentence to uppercase using multi-threading.
* It initializes a mutex, creates threads for each character, and ensures thread-safe access to the shared 'sentence' array. 
* Upon completion, it destroys the mutex.
